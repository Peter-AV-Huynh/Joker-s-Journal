# Joker's Journal

Here is my Demo Day project titled "Joker's Journal". My goal for this project is to create an online gaming community for my favorite all-time video game, Persona 5. I wanted an application that various users could use to share their journeys with one another and to keep a personal log of their own journey throughout the game.

Enjoy!
